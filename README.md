# 🌟 Welcome to Betül's GitHub Wonderland 🌟  

👋 Hi there! I'm Betül, a developer who believes in the magic of tea, coffee, and code.

## 💡 About Me  
- 🔍 **Debugging Expertise**:  
   - 2/3 of my bug fixes: "Wait, what even is this?!"  
   - The other 1/3: "Oh... typo. Classic me."  

- ☕ **Productivity Stats**:  
   - 1 cup of tea/coffee = ~50 lines of code (because priorities).  
   - Tea/Coffee first, code second. Always.  

- 🎯 **Mission**:  
   - To transform data into insights, and insights into actions. Making machine learning models smarter, one dataset at a time.  📊
   - To write clean, efficient, and maintainable code that even future me will appreciate. And maybe add a bit of magic along the way.  🧙🏻
   - To never stop learning, experimenting, and growing. Every line of code is a step closer to my next big breakthrough.
   - To optimize workflows and processes to be as efficient as my code. Because time is precious, but coffee is essential.
   - To write code that doesn't break... at least not immediately. And if it does, to make sure it's as funny as possible. 🤣
